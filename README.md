# Deep Learning Image Applications

A collection of deep learning image applications implemented in **Colab**.

---

## Applications

- **Face Generation (StyleGAN)** – Generate realistic face images.  
- **Image-to-Image Translation (CycleGAN)** – Transform images between two domains.  
- **Super-Resolution (SRGAN / ESRGAN)** – Enhance image resolution.  
- **Text-to-Image Generation** – Generate images from text prompts.  
- **Data Augmentation** – Create multiple variations of input images.

## Features

- Interactive image upload in Colab  
- GPU-accelerated training and inference  
- Visualize results directly in the notebook  

---

## Usage

1. Open the Colab notebook.  
2. Upload your images.  
3. Run cells to generate, translate, augment, or enhance images.  
4. View results in `/results` or download directly.
